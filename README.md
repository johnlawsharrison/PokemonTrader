# PokemonTrader
PokemonTrader is a trading card game based on the Pokemon universe.

Users start the game with 3 randomly selected Pokemon from the original 151 Pokemon of the first generation.

Users can post trade offers on a globally accessible board which other players can respond to and propose trades.

By "trading" Pokemon cards, each user obtains a copy of the other user's offered Pokemon, which gains one level in the process.

Your overall score in the game is determined by the total of the levels of all of the Pokemon in your inventory
(in the future this might change to reflect the "rarity" of specific types/species)

In order to post and accept trades you are required to sign in with a valid email.

Have fun!
